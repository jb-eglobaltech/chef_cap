= Chef Cap

* http://github.com/casecommons/chef_cap/

== DESCRIPTION

capistrano + chef-solo == deployment + server automation

Using chef's JSON configuration format to drive capistrano and chef-solo so you can use both to not only deploy your application but also completely automate the configuration of your servers.

== INSTALL

Add chef_cap to your Gemfile

  group :development do
    gem 'chef_cap'
  end

Then run:

  $ bundle install

=== Rails 3

  $ rails generate chef_cap:install

=== Rails 2

Edit your Rakefile and add:

  require 'chef_cap/tasks' rescue nil

(alternatively do not rescue nil and do not put chef_cap in the development group in your Gemfile)

Then run:

  $ bundle exec rake chef_cap:install

Which will overwrite your Capfile and create a chef directory with sample files unless one already exists.
